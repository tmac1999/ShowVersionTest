# ShowVersionTest
##### This plugin provides a panel showed versionName of every module of a Android Project,when we are practicing CI(Continuous Integration) or other rapid iteration model,I usually forget my Working copy belongs to which version （Especially the VCS was svn ），it helps me quickly find the versionName of every module.Click the TextArea,the gradle file will open in editor view.
#### This is a raw version ,the sketch just as the following :

#### When click the TextArea,the gradle file will open in editor view.Like this:

##### It still remains some todos:


##### 1.If use a VERSION reference in gradle file,I still cant figure out how to invoke the gradle method "getVersion()" .


##### 2.The panel was ugly :))
